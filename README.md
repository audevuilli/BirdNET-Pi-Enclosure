## DIY Wood Enclosure - BirdNET-Pi

Hello! We are happy to share with you the instructions and design files to build your own DIY Enclosure to host your BirdNET-Pi.

- A fun designed enclosure that has been inspired by "AngryBirds". 
- Host your RPi and microphone. Nice enclosure to have in your garden or on your balcony. 
- Contribute to the BirdNET-Pi's community and thank Patrick for his work and everyone else for all the helpful pieces of advice. 

## List of Materials - BOM
- RPi with BirdNET-Pi installed.
- USB Lapel Microphone (other microphones are also possible, but the design files may need to be slightly modified).
- Power cable 
- 1x 6mm and 1x 3mm wood sheet
- 1x Cable Gland PG11
- 1x [IP65 Plastic Enclosure](https://bit.ly/3ydXBJf)
- Wood glue & double-sided tape
- Access to a laser cutter (visit your local maker space, or ask in your community where you could possibly access one!)
- Access to a drill with a 20mm hole saw drill bit (visit your local maker space, or ask in your community where you could possibly access one!) 

## Building Steps
### 1. Laser Cutting
Open the .dxf or the .3dm (for Rhino's users) and select all the objects to print. The current design file has 3 different layer according to the type of cut (cut, etch a surface, draw a line). 

If you need some help with laser cutting, have a look at the great article by the [Maker Design Lab: "Hot to Get Started with Laser Cutting"](https://makerdesignlab.com/tutorials-tips/laser-cutting-beginners-guide/). It will give you all the necessary background! 

### 2. Assemblage

1. Screw the cable gland on the side of the plastic enclosure, the longer part towards the outside.

2. Pass the microphone through the cable gland, the microphone head should be outside of the plastic box. Then, pass the USB cable with the USB C connector towards the inside of the plastic box. Make sure the cable gland is tight.

3. Cut a piece of double-sided tape and add it along the back of the RPi Enclosure. Stick the enclosure in the plastic box with both microphone and power cable already connected to the RPi.

4. Take the remaining part of the power cable and pass it through the hole in the back of the bird. Cut a piece of double-sided tape and add it along the back of the plastic box. Stick the bottom of plastic box to the back of the bird.

5. Along the edge of the bird's back, make a thin line of wood glue. Take the bird's edge and place it around it, in the little holes. Press on it a little bit to allow to dry.

Close the plastic box. Pass through the little hole of the bird's face the microphone head. Position the bird's face and add the bird's pick. Well done!! You can take it outdoor and listen to the birds!

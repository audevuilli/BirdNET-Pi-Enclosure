## DIY Wood Enclosure - BirdNET-Pi

Hello! We are happy to share with you the instructions and design files to build your own DIY Enclosure to host your BirdNET-Pi.

- A fun designed enclosure that has been inspired by "AngryBirds". 
- Host your RPi and microphone. Nice enclosure to have in your garden or on your balcony. 
- Contribute to the BirdNET-Pi's community and thank Patrick for his work and everyone else for all the helpful pieces of advice. 

## List of Materials - BOM
- RPi with BirdNET-Pi installed.
- USB Lapel Microphone (other microphones are also possible, but the design files may need to be slightly modified).
- Power cable 
- 1x 6mm and 1x 3mm wood sheet
- 1x Cable Gland PG11
- 1x [IP65 Plastic Enclosure](https://bit.ly/3ydXBJf)
- Wood glue & double-sided tape
- Access to a laser cutter (visit your local maker space, or ask in your community where you could possibly access one!)
- Access to a drill with a 20mm hole saw drill bit (visit your local maker space, or ask in your community where you could possibly access one!) 

## Building Steps
### 1. Laser Cutting
Open the .dxf or the .3dm (for Rhino's users) and select all the objects to print. The current design file has 3 different layer according to the type of cut (cut, etch a surface, draw a line). 

If you need some help with laser cutting, have a look at the great article by the [Maker Design Lab: "Hot to Get Started with Laser Cutting"](https://makerdesignlab.com/tutorials-tips/laser-cutting-beginners-guide/). It will give you all the necessary background! 

### 2. Assemblage

1. Screw the cable gland on the side of the plastic enclosure, the longer part towards the outside.
